INTERSECTARR
Find the intersection of two sorted arrays.
OR in other words,
Given 2 sorted arrays, find all the elements which occur in both the arrays.

Example :

Input : 
    A : [1 2 3 3 4 5 6]
    B : [3 3 5]

Output : [3 3 5]

Input : 
    A : [1 2 3 3 4 5 6]
    B : [3 5]

Output : [3 5]
 NOTE : For the purpose of this problem ( as also conveyed by the sample case ), assume that elements that appear more than once in both arrays should be included multiple times in the final output.

class Solution:
    # @param A : tuple of integers
    # @param B : tuple of integers
    # @return a list of integers
    def intersect(self, A, B):
        o = []
        i = j = 0
        while i < len(A) and j < len(B):
            if A[i] == B[j]:
                o.append(A[i])
                i+=1
                j+=1
            elif A[i] < B[j]:
                i+=1
            else:
                j+=1
        return o
